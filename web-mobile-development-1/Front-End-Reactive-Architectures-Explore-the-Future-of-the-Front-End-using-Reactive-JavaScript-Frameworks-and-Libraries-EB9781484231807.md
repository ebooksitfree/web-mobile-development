Book Description
-----------------

 Learn how to use reactive architectures on the front-end. There are many technologies using a reactive approach on the back end, but this book teaches you how the reactive manifesto can be used to benefit your front-end programming as well.
You will discover what reactive programming is, what the current front-end ecosystem looks like, and how to use a range of frameworks and libraries. You will also apply specific reactive architectures in your own projects. Each concept is taught with a mix of technical explanations and real-world code implementations. 
The future of front-end programming and architecture is reactive – don’t get left behind: Add Front-End Reactive Architectures to your library today.
