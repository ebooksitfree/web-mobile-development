Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
jQuery in Action, Third Edition, is a fast-paced and complete guide to jQuery, focused on the tasks you'll face in nearly any web dev project. Written for readers with minimal JavaScript experience, this revised edition adds new examples and exercises, along with the deep and practical coverage you expect from an In Action book. You'll learn how to traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, write plugins, and even unit test your code. The unique lab pages anchor each concept with real-world code. Several new chapters teach you how to interact with other tools and frameworks to build modern single-page web applications.
About the Book
Thanks to jQuery, no one remembers the bad old days when programmers manually managed browser inconsistencies, CSS selectors support, and DOM navigation, and when every animation was a frustrating exercise in raw JavaScript. The elegant, intuitive jQuery library beautifully manages these concerns, and jQuery 3 adds even more features to make your life as a web developer smooth and productive.
