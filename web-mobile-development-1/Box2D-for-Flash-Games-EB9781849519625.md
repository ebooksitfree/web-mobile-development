Book Description
-----------------

Create amazing and realistic physics Flash games using Box2D
Design blockbuster physics game and handle every kind of collisionBuild and destroy levels piece by pieceCreate vehicles and bring them to life with motorsIn Detail
Physics games are getting more and more popular, and Box2D is the best choice if you are looking for a free, stable and robust library to handle physics. With Box2D you can create every kind of 2D physics game, only coding is not the fun part, but the game itself.
"Box2D for Flash Games" will guide you through the process of making a Flash physics game starting from the bare bones and taking you by hand through complex features such as forces, joints and motors. As you are learning, your game will have more and more features, like the physics games you are used to playing.
The book analyzes two of the most played physics games, and breaks them down to allow readers to build them from scratch in a step-by-step approach.
By the end of the book, you will learn how to create basic primitive bodies as well as complex, compound bodies. Motors will give life to cars, catapults and siege machines firing bullets, while a complete collision management will make your game look even more realistic.
If you want to make full Flash games with physics, then Box2D for Flash Games will guide you through the entire process of making a Flash physics game.
