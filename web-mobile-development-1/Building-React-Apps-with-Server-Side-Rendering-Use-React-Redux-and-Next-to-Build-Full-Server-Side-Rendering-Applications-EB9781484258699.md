Book Description
-----------------


    
    Leverage the benefits of both client-side and server-side rendering to get the most out of your React applications. By the end of this book you will be able to build and deploy React applications using the Next.js framework to fully render server-side HTML on every Web page.
You'll begin by reviewing JavaScript fundamentals and how they work with the core principles of React. You'll then move on to Next.js, the React framework for server-rendered applications. Using this framework, you will create a fast and secure solutional React application that renders content on the server-side, protects sensitive information, and optimizes response times. Before deploying the application using Docker containers, you'll create automated unit tests to verify that every component is appropriately doing its job
Building React Apps with Server-Side Rendering also covers other fun and interesting topics such as Bootstrap 4, JSX (JavaScript XML), adding styling to your React applications, and much more. By the end of this book, you will be able to build and deploy React applications that fully render server-side HTML on every page. In the end you'll have a client-side rendered React application that integrates server-side rendering into it using Next.js framework.What You'll Learn
