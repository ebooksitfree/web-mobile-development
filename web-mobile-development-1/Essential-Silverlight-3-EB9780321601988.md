Book Description
-----------------

“The book you are holding contains the keys to writing great Silverlight 3 applications. Use them well!”
–From the Foreword by Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president, Microsoft Developer Division
Microsoft Silverlight is a leading cross-platform, Rich Internet Application (RIA) technology that allows you to create more compelling and interactive Web experiences than are possible with simple HTML browser pages. Silverlight 3 includes significant improvements over previous versions, including “out-of-browser” operation, H.264 video, 3D graphics, and real-time effects.
Essential Silverlight 3 is the definitive reference and insider’s guide. It not only covers all the key features of the Silverlight 3 runtime and how to use them but, in Under the Hood sections, explains why each feature was developed and how each one works. These “insider” explanations often lead to concise, practical performance tips that can help you speed up your own Silverlight applications.
Author Ashraf Michail is uniquely qualified to explain Silverlight 3. He is a Microsoft Silverlight architect who has guided Silverlight from its beginnings through the current version. In this book, he shows how to 
 Integrate the principles and components of a Silverlight application, including XAP, XAML, and .NET code 
 Use Silverlight vector graphics, bitmap images, and animation 
 Display predictable and readable text across platforms and animate text elements 
 Obtain mouse and keyboard input, including mouse wheel events 
 Implement smooth animations to improve your user interface and make your application more pleasing to the user 
 Use the Canvas, StackPanel, Grid, and Border elements to lay out your application and define custom layout elements 
 Play high-quality, live, and on-demand video and audio 
 Customize the built-in and toolkit controls and develop new custom Silverlight controls 
 Connect to and synchronize with data using Silverlight Data Binding 
 Use built-in real-time effects and define custom HLSL pixel shaders 
 Enable GPU-accelerated rendering  
If you are a developer who is getting started with Silverlight or an expert Silverlight developer who is interested in understanding the inner workings of the Silverlight runtime, this book is for you.
