Book Description
-----------------

Using Drupal, web professionals can create full-featured websites with just a few clicks. Drupal’s core is compact and well documented, but much of Drupal’s immense power lies elsewhere: in external modules that, until now, have not been well documented. Now, however, there’s Drupal’s Building Blocks, an authoritative tutorial, reference, and cookbook for Drupal’s most valuable modules.
The authors are Drupal insiders who’ve spent years creating and supporting these modules–Earl Miles, developer of the Views module, and Lynette Miles, Drupal documentation team member. They’ve brought together indispensable, up-to-date information you won’t find anywhere else, as well as extensive sample “recipe” code designed for easy adaptation and reuse. Learn how to
 Use Content Construction Kit (CCK) to customize your data around your needs 
 Improve site flexibility with Drupal’s node system 
 Add optional field types, including PHP-based fields 
 Use modules with themes to display data more attractively and legibly 
 Build powerful Views query displays 
 Integrate with SQL databases 
 Customize Views with relationships, arguments, and filters 
 Optimize query performance 
 Add styling through the Panel UI or custom-code-based designs 
 Maintain full control over sites as you deploy into production 
This book will help you create more powerful, flexible, usable, and manageable websites—whether you’re a web developer, designer, administrator, architect, or consultant.
