Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Isomorphic Web Applications teaches you to build production-quality web apps using isomorphic architecture. Designed for working developers, this book offers examples in relevant frameworks like React, Redux, Angular, Ember, and webpack.
About the Technology
Build secure web apps that perform beautifully with high, low, or no bandwidth. Isomorphic web apps employ a pattern that exploits the full stack, storing data locally and minimizing server hits. They render flawlessly, maximize SEO, and offer opportunities to share code and libraries between client and server.
About the Book
Isomorphic Web Applications teaches you to build production-quality web apps using isomorphic architecture. You�ll learn to create and render views for both server and browser, optimize local storage, streamline server interactions, and handle data serialization. Designed for working developers, this book offers examples in relevant frameworks like React, Redux, Angular, Ember, and webpack. You�ll also explore unique debugging and testing techniques and master specific SEO skills.
