Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Express in Action is a carefully designed tutorial that teaches you how to build web applications using Node and Express.
About the Technology
Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. Express organizes your server-side JavaScript into testable, maintainable modules. It provides a powerful set of features to efficiently manage routes, requests, and views along with beautiful boilerplate for your web applications. Express helps you concentrate on what your application does instead of managing time-consuming technical details.
