Book Description

 Quickly discover solutions to common problems, best practices you can follow, and everything JavaScript has to offer.

With JavaScript Recipes you will learn language fundamentals like types, conversions, execution contexts, expressions, operators, statements, and built-in objects. You'll explore and make the most of your script’s host environment and how to create your own JavaScript host using Google’s V8 engine.
