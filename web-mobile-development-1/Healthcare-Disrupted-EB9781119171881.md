-----------------

 “During a time of tremendous change and uncertainty, Healthcare Disrupted gives executives a framework and language to determine how they will evolve their products, services, and strategies to flourish in a increasingly value-based healthcare system. Using a powerful mix of real world examples and unanswered questions, Elton and O’Riordan lead you to see that ‘no action’ is not an option—and push you to answer the most important question: ‘What is your role in this digitally driven change and how can your firm can gain competitive advantage and lead?’”—David Epstein, Division Head, Novartis Pharmaceuticals
“Healthcare Disrupted is an inspirational call-to-action for everyone associated with healthcare, especially the innovators who will develop the next generation of therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices.”—Bob Horvitz, Ph.D., David H. Koch Professor of Biology, MIT; Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
“In a time of dizzying change across all fronts: from biology, to delivery, to the use of big data, Health Disrupted captures the impact of these forces and thoughtfully develops new approaches to value creation in the healthcare industry. A must-read for those who strive to capitalize on change and reinvent the industry.”—Deborah Dunsire, M.D., president and CEO, FORUM Pharmaceuticals 
Healthcare at a Crossroad: Seismic Shifts, New Business Models for Success
Healthcare Disrupted is an in-depth look at the disruptive forces driving change in the the healthcare industry and provides guide for defining new operating and business models in response to these profound changes.
Based on original research conducted by Accenture and years of experience working with the most successful companies in the industry, healthcare experts Jeff Elton and Anne O’Riordan provide an informed, insightful view of the state of the industry, what's to come, and new emerging business models for life sciences companies play a different role from the past in  to driving superior outcomes for patients and  playing a bigger role in creating greater value for healthcare overall. Their book explains how critical global healthcare trends are challenging legacy strategies and business models, and examines why historical leaders in the industy must evolve, to stay relevant and compete with new entrants.
Healthcare Disrupted captures this pivotal point in time to give executives and senior managers across pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, medical device, medical diagnostics, digital  technology, and health services companies an opportunity to step back and consider the changing landscape. This book gives companies options for how to adapt and stay relevant  and outlines four new business models that can drive sustainable growth and performance. It demonstrates how real-world data (from Electronic Medical Records, health wearables, Internet of Things, digital media, social media, and other sources) is combining with scalable technologies and advanced analytics to fundamentally change how and where healthcare is delivered, bridging to the health of populations, and broadening the resposibility for both. It reveals how this shift in healthcare delivery will significantly improve patient outcomes and the value health systems realize.
