    Maintaining an iOS project often results in thousands of code files scattered around your folders. Did you ever wanted to reuse those files with other projects but found yourself making copies of Swift files? You are not alone! Many iOS developers struggle with this issue as well—unorganized projects, duplicated files, difficulty in testing, and long complication times.&nbsp; This book will show how Swift Package Manager can help you handle these problems by restructuring your project to make it efficient and straightforward.&nbsp;Swift Package Manager isn’t magic, but you’ll likely need a little guidance in using this nifty tool. You'll see how to reorganize projects smartly and efficiently, create your first Swift package, and learn what libraries are in this context. Then share your package with the rest of your projects. Next test your library’s quality. And then take your library to the next level of power by including files that go beyond just code.&nbsp;By going over the methodology of big project organization, you will have the ability to extend your project into the future as Apple sees it. Make no mistake—the path for a modular and flexible project is not easy. With the help of Swift Package Manager, it becomes possible and worth it.
