Book Description
-----------------

 Enrich your software design skills and take a guided tour of the wild, vast, and untamed frontier that is JavaScript development. Especially useful for frontend developers, this revision includes specific chapters on React and VueJS, as well as an updated one on Angular. To help you get the most of your new skills, each chapter also has a "further reading" section.
This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries and frameworks, such as Angular, VueJS, React, Grunt, Yeoman, RequireJS, Browserify, Knockout, Kraken, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash. It also covers utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers and tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side.
 
While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Development focuses on incredibly useful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores.
