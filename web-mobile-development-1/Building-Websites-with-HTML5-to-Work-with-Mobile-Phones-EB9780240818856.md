Book Description
-----------------

The goal of this ebook is to introduce you to mobile Web development. In many ways it is very similar to desktop Web site development - HTML5 is HTML5 no matter what device you install it on.What is different is how you use and interface with the device. Smartphones and tablets like the iPad, iPhone, and android devices are just very different than laptops and desktops. 
Find out how to work within mobile versions of popular web browsers while maximizing your design with HTML5 and CSS3 basics. Discover how to place items, work with fonts, and control color detail as well as other critical yet simple design elements.Work on graphical control with Bitmap, SVG and Canvas elements
