CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards Solutions is your indispensable guide to cutting-edge CSS development—this book demystifies the secrets of CSS.

It sometimes feels like there are a million and one different techniques to master, spread across a bewildering array of websites. The range of possibilities seems endless and makes for a steep and daunting learning curve.
