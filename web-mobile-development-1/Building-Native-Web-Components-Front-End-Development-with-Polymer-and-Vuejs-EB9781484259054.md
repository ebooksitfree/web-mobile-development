Book Description
-----------------

Start developing single-page applications (SPAs) with modern architecture. This book shows you how to create, design, and publish native web components, ultimately allowing you to piece together those elements in a modern JavaScript framework.
Building Native Web Components&nbsp;dives right in and gets you started building your first web component. You’ll be introduced to native web component design systems and frameworks and discuss component-driven development to understand its importance in large-scale companies. You’ll then move on to building web components using templates and APIs, and custom event lifecycles.&nbsp;Techniques and best practices for moving data, customizing, and distributing components are also covered. Throughout, you’ll develop a foundation to start using Polymer, Vue.js, and Firebase in your day-to-day work.
Confidently apply modern patterns and develop workflows to build agnostic software pieces that can be reused in SPAs. Building Native Web Components&nbsp;is your guide to developing small and autonomous web components that are focused, independent, reusable, testable, and works with all JavaScript frameworks, modern browsers, and libraries.
