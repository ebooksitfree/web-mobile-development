As in years past, Michael Allen's Annual offers a diverse and important collection that contains some of the most current insights and best practices that will help both educators and workplace learning leaders address issues of design and implementation, as well as strategy and culture.
In addition, this new volume offers a diverse mix of content that spans the full spectrum of technology-based learning.

Praise forMichael Allen's 2012 e-Learning Annual
"Michael Allen's Annual really is annual. I found new examples and provocative ideas—just what I was looking for."
—Allison Rossett, professor of educational technology, San Diego State University
"Just another academic anthology? Hardly! Michael Allen has convinced e-learning's super-heroes to join forces to crush complacency, demolish dogma, rewrite rules, streamline strategies, and light a brighter future for e-learning. Warning: The accumulated wisdom and original thinking of this elite team of designers, practitioners, consultants, and researchers will leave you dissatisfied with your current e-learning efforts and aching to put their ideas into play."
—William Horton, author, e-Learning by Designand consultant, William Horton Consulting
"The real learning at conferences takes place in the hallways. This wonderful book is like eavesdropping on those conversations, except that Michael has put the top thinkers in our field in the hall for you."
