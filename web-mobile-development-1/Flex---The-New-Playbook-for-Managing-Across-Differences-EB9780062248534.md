Book Description
-----------------

 The workplace around the world is changing—growing increasingly multicultural, female, and younger. Experts often tell CEOs and managers what not to do, and corporate diversity programs can often appear to be like defensive measures against lawsuits and harassment charges. While technology has connected all of us as a global workforce, it has not equipped us with the capability to interact genuinely with people. In order to be successful in this new global business environment, we need to rethink the way we lead others.
Flex offers a new approach—a proactive strategy for managers to understand and leverage difference effectively in this new global economy.
Flex shows managers how to
  understand the power gap—the social distance between you and those in the workplace of different cultures, ages, and gender;  stretch your management style and bridge the gap with more effective communication and feedback tools; and  multiply the effect by teaching these skills to others and closing the power gap with clients, customers, and partners to create innovative solutions.Creating flex in a company's management style will affect all aspects of developing existing leaders, attracting future talent, and building relationships with customers in this competitive marketplace. Flex shows you how.
