Book Description
-----------------

One of the most exciting and talked about aspects of the HTML5 specification is the introduction of in-browser multimedia.  Websites no longer have to rely on a third-party tool such as Flash or Silverlight to play video and audio. This book is an easy, approachable guide to building native HTML5 multimedia into a website, from the simplest addition to more advanced features. It's written in a simple, straightforward style that's not too techy,  yet advanced enough for the more experienced coder who just needs to get up to speed on these powerful new capabilities. The book's companion website provides all the examples in a working format for easy access and enhanced visualization for the reader.
Topics include:
Using Audio: How to add audio to web documents using the HTML5 audio element.
Using Video: How to add video to web documents using the HTML5 video element.
JavaScript API and Custom Controls: How to use the HTML5 Media JavaScript API to create custom controls for HTML5 audio and video.
Styling Media Elements with CSS: Shows how HTML5 media elements can be styled with CSS2.1 and CSS3.
 Using Video with SVG: Shows how SVG and HTML5 video can work together.
