Book Description
-----------------

Develop a working understanding of events and components, and containers and states so you can build and deploy RIAs in Flex. Work through a demo implementation of a login panel that employs feedback from the server side, to hone your understanding. Use the validators and the debugger to inspect your code execution. Building User Interaction is the second of five articles that will be compiled in the book, Data Visualization with Flash Builder: Designing RIA and AIR Applications with Remote Data Sources. Each full-color article illustrates specific aspects of Flash Builder data visualization with techniques to employ them. The book, Data Visualization with Flash Builder, features exclusive material in the form of a related real-world tutorial project to go alongside each article. This article is equivalent to 33 print pages.
