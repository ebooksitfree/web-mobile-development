Book Description
-----------------

 Learn how to build scalable APIs using the Node.js platform and ES6 (EcmaScript 2015) with this quick, informative guide.
Developing systems for the wide range of devices available in the modern world requires the construction of APIs designed to work only with data in a centralized manner, allowing client-side applications to be developed separately and have a unique interface for the final user.
Node.js has proven itself to be an excellent platform for building REST APIs because of its single-thread architecture. It has a low learning curve and can be understood by anyone who has a basic understanding of the JavaScript language.
Use Building APIs with Node.js today to understand how Node.js APIs work, and how you can build your own.
What You Will Learn
Build scalable APIs using the Node.js platform
Use ES6, Express, Passport, ApiDoc, Mocha, Helmet and more
Integrate an SQL database through Sequelize.js and build a single page application using Vanilla.js
Who This Book Is For
Ideal for developers who have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.
