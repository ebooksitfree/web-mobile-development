Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Getting MEAN teaches readers how to develop web applications end-to-end using the MEAN stack. You'll systematically discover each technology in the MEAN stack as you build up an application one layer at a time, just as you'd do in a real project.
About the Technology
Traditional web dev stacks use a different programming language in every layer, resulting in a complex mashup of code and frameworks. Together, the MongoDB database, the Express and AngularJS frameworks, and Node.js constitute the MEAN stack—a powerful platform that uses only one language, top to bottom: JavaScript. Developers and businesses love it because it’s scalable and cost-effective. End users love it because the apps created with it are fast and responsive. It’s a win-win-win!
About the Book
Getting MEAN teaches you how to develop web applications using the MEAN stack. First, you’ll create the skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and then push it up to a live web server. Next, add a MongoDB database and build an API before using Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser. Finally you’ll add an authentication system to the application, using the whole stack. When you finish, you’ll have all the skills you need to build a dynamic data-driven web application.
What’s Inside
Full-stack development using JavaScript
Responsive web techniques
Everything you need to get started with MEAN
Best practices for efficiency and reusability
About the Reader
Readers should have some web development experience. This book is based on MongoDB 2, Express 4, Angular 1, and Node.js 4.
