Book Description
-----------------

A curious JavaScript developer's practical guide to deep dive into Deno and get the most out of it for building secure web applications
Key FeaturesUnderstand Deno's essential concepts and featuresLearn how to use Deno in real-world scenariosUse Deno to develop, test, and deploy web applications and toolsDeno is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime with secure defaults and a great developer experience. With Deno Web Development, you'll learn all about Deno's primitives, its principles, and how you can use them to build real-world applications. The book is divided into three main sections: an introduction to Deno, building an API from scratch, and testing and deploying a Deno application.
The book starts by getting you up to speed with Deno's runtime and the reason why it was developed. You'll explore some of the concepts introduced by Node, why many of them transitioned into Deno, and why new features were introduced. After understanding Deno and why it was created, you will start to experiment with Deno, exploring the toolchain and writing simple scripts and CLI applications. As you progress to the second section, you will create a simple web application and then add more features to it. This application will evolve from a simple 'hello world' API to a web application connected to the database, with users, authentication, and a JavaScript client. In the third section, the book will take you through topics such as dependency management, configuration and testing, finishing with an application deployed in a cloud environment.
By the end of this web development book, you will become comfortable with using Deno to create, maintain, and deploy secure and reliable web applications.
