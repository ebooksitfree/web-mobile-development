One of the key concerns of any e-commerce company is ensuring customers complete the checkout process successfully, and for them to return. Unfortunately, many checkouts still suffer from a high level of drop-out. The Payment Request API is an open standard being developed by browser vendors to simplify payments for users with a quick and seamless autofill process enabling a broader set of online payment providers to participate in the market.
