Book Description
-----------------

 Explore the modern concepts of client-server web applications. This book includes examples that are simple to comprehend building apps that are not much different from real-world applications. Each chapter develops a different subject, explaining the concept from A to Z, and provides a project with complete source code and configuration steps. 
Chapters also include thorough coverage of the subject described and the full source code is provided with a consistently updated repo on GitHub, accounting for the frequent changes made to language versions. The chapter apps use HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Apache, Lighttpd, SSL/TLS, DDNS, Shell Programming, Sockets programming, tools such as Wireshark, and remote online tools for testing. 
  As you master each topic sequentially you'll fully understand the inner workings of the client-server apps and become confident in creating your own web-based apps. Whether you want to work on the web for fun, for school, or for work, Web-Based Projects that Rock the Class is a great place to start.What You'll Learn
