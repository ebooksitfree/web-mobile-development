Book Description
-----------------

Script Analysis for Actors, Directors, and Designers teaches the skills of script analysis using a formalist approach that examines the written part of a play to gauge how the play should be performed and designed. Treatments of both classic and unconventional plays are combined with clear examples, end-of-chapter questions, and stimulating summaries that will allow actors, directors and designers to immediately incorporate the concepts and processes into their theatre production work. 
Now thoroughly revised, the fifth edition contains a new section on postmodernism and postdramatic methods of script analysis, along with additional material for designers.
