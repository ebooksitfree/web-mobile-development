Book Description
-----------------

Principles of Web ADI Design is a comprehensive, start-to-finish guide to the processes required for effective API design. Unlike other books, it covers the entire lifecycle. Leading API and microservices consultant James Higginbotham shows how API development teams can successfully integrate processes that occur before, during, and after API design, to scale API development far beyond single individuals or small teams. Higginbotham addresses REST in depth while also fully covering RPC and graph-based API design, as well as messaging, streaming, and event-based async APIs. Coverage includes
The art of API design, and an overview of the API design process
Crafting job stories, conducting EventStorming sessions, and modeling API capabilities
Designing APIs that can easily evolve
Implementing APIs, and moving to microservices
Improving API quality through effective testing, documentation, and protection mechanisms
Establishing and maturing your API program: leveraging program and data management techniques that scale
