Book Description
-----------------

 Learn how to institute Reactive Programming (RP) for your back-end development with Node.js. Up to now, RP has most often been used in front-end development, but with its cutting-edge approach you can also transform your back-end programming.
Reactive Programming with Node.js will show you the paradigms of RP, why you should use it, and the variations available to you. You will learn how to use the main libraries necessary to provide an enhanced development experience in Node.js, including RxJS, Bacon.js, Kefir.js, and Highland.js. You will also create a custom library that provides a variety of key features, and learn how to scale up a system developed using RP in Node.js.
Ideal for back-end developers with knowledge of Node.js or JavaScript, this book enables you to get up and running with RP in Node.js, and revolutionize your back-end development.
What You'll Learn:
Review the variations of Reactive programming
Use the main libraries that provide this type of development experience in Node.js
Create a custom library
Scale up a system developed using RP in Node.js
Who This Book Is For:
Any back-end developers who understand Node.js or are advanced enough to pick up the basics. Ideal for developers who have an interest in learning about this different programming paradigm that's being used more and more every day.
