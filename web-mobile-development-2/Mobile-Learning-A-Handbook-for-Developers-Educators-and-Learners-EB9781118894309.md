Book Description
-----------------

Explore the game-changing technology that allows mobile learning to effectively reach K-12 students
Mobile Learning: A Handbook for Developers, Educators and Learners provides research-based foundations for developing, evaluating, and integrating effective mobile learning pedagogy. Twenty-first century students require twenty-first century technology, and mobile devices provide new and effective ways to educate children.
But with new technologies come new challenges—therefore, this handbook presents a comprehensive look at mobile learning by synthesizing relevant theories and drawing practical conclusions for developers, educators, and students.
Mobile devices—in ways that the laptop, the personal computer, and netbook computers have not—present the opportunity to make learning more engaging, interactive, and available in both traditional classroom settings and informal learning environments. From theory to practice, Mobile Learning explores how mobile devices are different than their technological predecessors, makes the case for developers, teachers, and parents to invest in the technology, and illustrates the many ways in which it is innovative, exciting, and effective in educating K-12 students.
Explores how mobile devices can support the needs of students
Provides examples, screenshots, graphics, and visualizations to enhance the material presented in the book
Provides developers with the background necessary to create the apps their audience requires
Presents the case for mobile learning in and out of classrooms as early as preschool
Discusses how mobile learning enables better educational opportunities for the visually impaired, students with Autism, and adult learners.
If you're a school administrator, teacher, app developer, or parent, this topical book provides a theoretical, well-researched discussion of the pedagogical theory and mobile learning, as well as practical advice in setting up a mobile learning strategy.
