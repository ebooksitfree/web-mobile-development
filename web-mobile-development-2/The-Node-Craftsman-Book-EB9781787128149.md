Book Description
-----------------

 Become a Node.js craftsman.
About This Book
This book will help readers to dive deeper into software development with Node.js and JavaScriptTakes a craftsman approach to Node.js and object-orientation and test-driven developmentCrafts many of the small details of Node.js and through to fully-fledged web applications with REST Who This Book Is For
This book is written to help you if you're working with Node.js already, but you want to move your craft to the next level with Node.js, so some working knowledge of Node.js is of course already assumed, so that we can look at the work of crafting applications with Node.
What You Will Learn
How to connect to databases like MongoDB and MySQL from your Node.js applicationHow to unit tests and end-to-end tests for your codeWhen and how to leverage migrations for setting up a continuous deployment workflowDetailed insight into how the Node Package Manager, NPM worksHow object-orientation actually works in JavaScriptWays to keep your code fast and efficient using asynchronous and non-blocking operationsHow to use and create event emittersHow to use REST frameworks to write full-fledged web applicationsHow to integrate Node.js with AngularIn Detail
The Node Craftsman Book helps JavaScript programmers with basic Node.js knowledge to now thoroughly master Node.js and JavaScript. This book dives you deeper into the craft of software development with Node.js and JavaScript, incuding object-orientation, test-driven development, database handling, web frameworks, and much more.
The Node Craftsman Book shows you how to work with Node.js and how to think deeply about how you build your Node projects. You'll master how to build a complete Node.js application across six crafting milestones, and you'll learn many specific skills to achieve that mastery. These skills include how to work with the Node Package Manager in depth, how to connect your Node applications to databases, and how to write unit tests and end-to-end tests for your code. You'll experience the full Node.js development picture, and learn how to craft and control your Node.js applications - right through to fully-fledged web applications using REST, and integration with Angular applications.
Style and approach
This book builds on your early knowledge and experience of Node.js and takes a craftsman approach to understanding the whole picture more deeply and shaping your Node applications to perform the way a craftsman would want. So, we take a thoughtful and broad thinking and coding approach to work with Node.js in this book.
