Book Description
-----------------

 Fully updated! Fifty Powerful, Easy-to-Use Rules for Supporting Hyper Growth
 
“Whether you’re taking on a role as a technology leader in a new company or you simply want to make great technology decisions, Scalability Rules will be the go-to resource on your bookshelf.”
–Chad Dickerson, CTO, Etsy
Scalability Rules, Second Edition, is the easy-to-use scalability primer and reference for every architect, developer, network/software engineer, web professional, and manager. Authors Martin L. Abbott and Michael T. Fisher have helped scale hundreds of high-growth companies and thousands of systems. Drawing on their immense experience, they present 50 up-to-the-minute technical best practices for supporting hyper growth practically anywhere.
 
Fully updated to reflect new technical trends and experiences, this edition is even easier to read, understand, and apply. Abbott and Fisher have also added powerful “stories behind the rules”: actual experiences and case studies from CTOs and technology executives at Etsy, NASDAQ, Salesforce, Shutterfly, Chegg, Warby Parker, Twitter, and other scalability pioneers.
 
Architects will find powerful technology-agnostic insights for creating and evaluating designs. Developers will discover specific techniques for handling everything from databases to state. Managers will get invaluable help in setting goals, making decisions, and interacting with technical teams. Whatever your role, you’ll find practical risk/benefit guidance for setting priorities, translating plans into action, and gaining maximum scalability at minimum cost.
 
You’ll learn how to
Simplify architectures and avoid “over-engineering”Design scale into your solution, so you can scale on a just-in-time basisMake the most of cloning and replicationSeparate functionality and split data setsScale out, not upGet more out of databases without compromising scalabilityEliminate unnecessary redirects and redundant double-checkingUse caches and CDNs more aggressively, without unacceptable complexityDesign for fault tolerance, graceful failure, and easy rollbackEmphasize statelessness, and efficiently handle state when you mustEffectively utilize asynchronous communicationLearn from your own mistakes and others’ high-profile failuresPrioritize your actions to get the biggest “bang for the buck”        Show and hide more
