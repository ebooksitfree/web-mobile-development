Silverlight is Microsoft’s new web-based User Interface (UI) technology, based on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), which is introducing many revolutionary concepts in the world of UI development. Silverlight uses XAML, with tools like Expression Design and Expression Blend, to create astonishing UI effects (such as gradients, compositions, and animations.) In addition to the richness of the UI elements, Silverlight 2 allows the use of C# or VB in addition to JavaScript to automate web pages. With Silverlight, you have the power of .NET on multiple platforms (IE and Firefox on Windows, Firefox and Safari on Macintosh, and Firefox on Linux). The author brings you up to speed very quickly with numerous hands-on examples.
Use XAML to create state-of-the-art user interfaces
Create XAML transforms and animations
Design compelling user experiences with Microsoft Expression Blend
Integrate media into your rich Internet applications
Program Silverlight with both JavaScript and .NET languages
Deploy Silverlight content to web pages
Encode videos with Expression Media Encoder
Make the most of Silverlight elements, resources, and styles
Use templates to quickly change your application’s look and feel
Efficiently debug Silverlight code
Use design tools to create graphics that import seamlessly into Silverlight
