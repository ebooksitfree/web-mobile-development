Book Description
-----------------

Praise for The handbook of Financing Growth
"Once again, Kenneth Marks and company have hit the mark with a comprehensive analysis of corporate and commercial finance, which is both readable and up-to-date. This book is a must for any entrepreneur, middle-market company CFO, or graduate student looking for a thorough presentation of real world financial solutions. I highly recommend it."
—Barry D. Yelton, Senior Vice President and Region Manager, Federal National Payables, Inc.
"This is a valuable tool to anyone raising capital. I've seen firsthand how the current environment is filled with dead ends for those seeking to grow their business. Having a blueprint for the process will save time and resources; two things any growth company can ill afford to spend. By looking at the process and explaining the various components of how capital forms, the authors provide necessary insight toward a productive effort. Anyone considering a capital raise should embark on that journey with this resource."
—Christopher Gaertner, Head of Technology Investment Banking, Managing Director, Merrill Lynch
"All principals involved in financing their growth should keep a copy of this book handy and refer to it frequently for guidance. It provides clear guidelines and case studies that can be used by any of the 27 million firms in the U.S. that want to grow."
—James F. Smith, PhD, Chief Economist, Parsec Financial Management
"Ken Marks and team have done a great service here to top management of middle-market companies, their advisors, as well as the investment community in understanding growth financing. This book is a perfect combination of being comprehensive (the glossary alone contains over 650 terms) yet very understandable. Too bad that more books written on this subject aren't written the way this one is."
—Bob Grabill, President and CEO, Chief Executive Network
"I am enthusiastic about this Second Edition of The Handbook of Financing Growth. The authors have updated chapters throughout and introduced a very useful, 'new project leadership' tool in Chapter 2. I can't imagine a more complete business financing guide. And, because of the tremendous amount of business wisdom contained herein, this book is valuable for its general business planning guidance alone. Highly recommended; a copy belongs in every entrepreneur's library!"
—Peter Pflasterer, entrepreneur and founder, JPS Communications, Inc.
"Considering the many financing challenges in the midst of our global recession, as a leading trade association for M&amp;A professionals, we believe the new edition of The Handbook of Financing Growth is essential reading for any business owner, advisor, or investor. This ambitious sharing of 'hands on' experiences will surely prove to be very rewarding for any decision maker in the private capital marketplace today!"
—Michael R. Nall, CPA, CM &amp; AA, and founder, Alliance of M&amp;A Advisors
