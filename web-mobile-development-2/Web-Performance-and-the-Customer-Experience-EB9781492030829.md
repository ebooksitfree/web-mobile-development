Book Description
-----------------

 IT executives in companies undergoing digital transformation have many stakeholders. Business units stress online sales, conversions, and self-service, while product owners push for new online features and products. Each group has its own key performance indicators (KPIs) for tracking progress.
Yet, one leading indicator essential to the success of all of these other metrics—web performance—is often neglected. Yet it’s the one area IT professionals directly control. In this article, professor and Comcast engineer Tom Barker explains how poor application performance can hinder your company’s digital transformation.
Customers quick to abandon slow-loading applications can be left with the impression that your site’s problems are indicative of other offerings. You’ll learn tips for addressing web performance on a large scale, including the recruitment of internal and external champions to help you set up processes and best practices for improving and maintaining your application’s day-to-day performance.
