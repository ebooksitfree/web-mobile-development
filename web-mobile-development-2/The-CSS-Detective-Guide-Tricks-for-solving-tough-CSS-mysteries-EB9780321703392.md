Book Description
-----------------

One of the toughest challenges novice CSS developers face is when seemingly perfect code doesn’t translate into a perfectly rendered browser page—and with all the different browsers available today, this happens all too often. The CSS Detective Guide aims to help, by teaching real world troubleshooting skills. You’ll learn how to track clues, analyze the evidence, and get to the truth behind CSS mysteries. These aren’t pat solutions, but rather strategies for thinking about CSS. Author Denise Jacobs begins by going over the basics of CSS with a special emphasis on common causes of problems. Then she shows you methods for giving your code the third degree. Then you’ll take a look at the line-up of usual suspects, the common problems and persistent bugs that are often encountered in CSS. Finally, you’ll have the chance to play detective and find the guilty culprit in:
The Case of the Devilish Details
The Case of the Mistaken Identity
The Case of the Single White Space
The Case of the Float with a Mind of Its Own
The Case of the Browser Who Hated Me
The Case of the LOL Layout
At the end, you’ll find that you can crack any case and solve any future mystery that you encounter, and your coding problems will become elementary. www.CssDetectiveGuide.com
