Book Description
-----------------

Some people find management so easy. They glide effortlessly onwards and upwards through the system, the politics, the people problems, the impossible targets and the work overload. They always seem to say the right thing, do the right thing and know instinctively how to handle every situation.  Is there something they know that the rest of us don’t? Is it something that we can all learn? The answer is a resounding yes. They know the Rules of Management. These golden principles show you how to inspire your team to perform (and what to do when it doesn’t). They reveal the secrets of managing yourself and your team in a way that gets results. The first edition of The Rules of Management became an instant classic, topping business bestseller charts around the world. Real managers from all kinds of backgrounds have testified as to the positive and immediate effect the Rules have had on their success. Your life will be easier. Your successes will be greater. And when you are headhunted or promoted (again) nobody will be surprised. Least of all you. Others can be good. You’ll be better.
