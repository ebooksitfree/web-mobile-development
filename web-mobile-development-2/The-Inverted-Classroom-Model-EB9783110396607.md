Book Description
-----------------

Only two years after its first run, the Inverted Classroom Conference has become a familiar event at Marburg University. Most conference participants not only knew about this digital teaching and learning scenario but were experienced users and developers. While during its predecessors most participants wanted to familiarize themselves with the central components of the Inverted Classroom Model, the focus of the 3rd German Inverted Classroom Conference in 2014, to which this conference volume is dedicated, was not only a discussion of variants of the model but also, for the first time, the inclusion of long-term evaluations and aspects of student behavior.This shift of emphasis is reflected in the contributions to this volume. Even though all central aspects of the ICM - content production and delivery, testing, and the in-class phase - are still addressed, we can now find recommendations concerning digital material acquisition, in-class tuition, the role of student tutors as well as first long-term studies about ICM effects.In general then, the focus was much wider than that of the first two ICM-conferences: from a new and originally non-familiar teaching and learning scenario to more general aspects of digitization of teaching and learning in the 21st century.
