Book Description
-----------------


    
    IBM® WebSphere® Process Server is a business
integration server that was built to support solutions that are
based on the service-oriented architecture (SOA). It plays a key
role in the architecture of the IBM SOA Foundation by providing
functionality for process services. Another key component of the
architecture is the enterprise service bus (ESB). IBM provides
three key ESB products: IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus,
WebSphere Message Broker, and the WebSphere DataPower Integration
Appliance XI50.
This IBM Redbooks® publication has been written for
architects who are planning an SOA solution and application
designers who are implementing an SOA solution with WebSphere
Process Server and WebSphere Message Broker. In this book, we
highlight the ESB capabilities of WebSphere Message Broker and
explain how you can leverage them with WebSphere Process Server. In
addition, we discuss interoperability and provide examples to
illustrate the integration of the two products.
