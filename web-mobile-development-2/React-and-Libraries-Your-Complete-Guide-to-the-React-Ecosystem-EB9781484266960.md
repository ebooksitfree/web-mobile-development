Book Description
-----------------

Harness the power of React and the related libraries that you need to know to deliver successful front-end implementations. Whether you are a beginner getting started or an existing React developer, this book will provide you with the must-have knowledge you need in your toolbox&nbsp;&nbsp;to build a complete app.&nbsp;


Start by learning how to create and style your own components, add state management, and manage routing. You’ll also learn how to work with the backend using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Once you have completed building your app you will learn how to deliver quality software by conducting unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end (E2E) testing, as well as learn techniques to debug, profile, and optimize your React app. 

Libraries and tools covered include TypeScript, Material-UI, Styled Components, SCSS, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Recoil, Jest, Enzyme, Sinon, MongoDB, NodeJS, Express, Serve, Grunt, Puppeteer, ESLint, Prettier and many others. And, you'll get access to bonus material and learn how to conduct and nail React interview questions.

Each chapter in this book can be used independently so you can pick and choose the information you’d like to learn. Use it to get deep into your React development world and find out why React has been rated the most loved framework by front-end developers for three years in a row.
