Book Description
-----------------

The Core iOS 6 Developer’s Cookbook brings together reliable, proven solutions for the heart of day-to-day iOS 6 development. World-renowned iOS programming expert Erica Sadun covers all the classes you’ll need to create successful iOS 6 mobile apps with standard APIs and interface elements and take full advantage of iOS 6 graphics, touches, and views.
As in her previous bestselling iOS books, Sadun translates today’s development best practices into working code, distilling key concepts into concise recipes that are easy to understand and transfer into your own projects. This isn’t just cut-and-paste; using her examples, Sadun fully explains both the “how” and “why” of effective iOS 6 development.
All code has been fully revised and extensively tested to reflect the latest iOS 6 features and the newest iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch capabilities. Throughout, every chapter groups related tasks together, so you can jump straight to your solution, without having to identify the right class or framework first. Coverage includes
Supporting direct user input through multitouch and gestures, including custom gesture recognizers
Building, customizing, and using iOS 6 controls
Alerting users via popup dialogs, progress bars, local notifications, popovers, audio pings, and other techniques
Assembling views and animation, organizing view hierarchies, and understanding how views work together
Using iOS 6’s breakthrough autolayout constraints system to simplify support for multiple screen geometries controlling keyboards, making onscreen elements “text aware,” and efficiently scanning and formatting text
Using view controllers to organize your users’ workspaces
Managing photos, videos, email, text messages, and iOS 6-enhanced social media updates
Implementing VoiceOver accessibility to reach even more users
Organizing apps simply and intuitively with tables and adding flexibility with iOS 6’s brand new collection views
Getting started with Core Data managed data stores
Leveraging iOS 6’s powerful networking and web services support
