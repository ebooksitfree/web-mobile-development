Developing Android applications using Android Studio 4.2, Java, and Android Jetpack
Key FeaturesDesign complex and responsive user interface layouts with the Android Studio 4.2 IDEBuild view model-based apps using the Jetpack architecture and use the latest Material Design components to build modern user interface designsIntegrate with SQLite databases and the Android Room Persistence LibraryAndroid Studio is an Integrated Development Environment based on the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. It provides developers with a unique platform to design and develop Android apps using various developer tools. The new Android Studio 4.2 has an upgraded IntelliJ platform and a variety of new features designed to improve the productivity of Android app developers. Fully updated for Android Studio 4.2, the objective of this book is to help you master the skills necessary to develop Android applications using Java as the programming language.
This book begins by outlining the steps necessary to set up an Android development and testing environment and introducing programming in Java, describing data types, flow control, functions, lambdas, and object-oriented programming. It includes an overview of Android Studio, covering areas such as tool windows, the code editor, and the Layout Editor tool. An introduction to Android architecture is followed by an in-depth explanation of the design of Android applications and user interfaces using the Android Studio environment.
Early chapters detail Android Architecture components like view models, lifecycle management, Room database access, the Database Inspector, app navigation, live data, and data binding.
