Book Description
-----------------

 The Golden Age of JavaScript began when web developers traded in their fat-server, thin-client approach for desktop-like web apps running in the browser. Unfortunately, that approach led to a succession of problems, so now the pendulum is swinging back in the other direction. Companies such as Walmart, Airbnb, Facebook, and Netflix have already adopted a new solution, using JavaScript code on both the client and server.
With this excerpt from O’Reilly’s upcoming book Building Isomorphic JavaScript Apps, you’ll learn how this method fixes nagging issues such as page-load speeds and SEO compatibility. Authors Jason Strimpel and Maxime Najim from WalmartLabs explain that isomorphic JavaScript is the latest in a series of engineering fixes that brings a harmonious equilibrium between the fat-server, fat-client pendulum.
Is isomorphic JavaScript the holy grail of web application development? Decide for yourself. Pick up this free excerpt and discover why this new code-sharing solution is such an important evolutionary step.
