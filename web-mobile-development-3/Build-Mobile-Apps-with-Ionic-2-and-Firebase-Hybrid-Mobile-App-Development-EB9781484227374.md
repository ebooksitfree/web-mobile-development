Using Apache Cordova, developers can create a new type of mobile app—a hybrid mobile app.Hybrid mobile apps actually run in an internal browser inside a wrapper created by Apache Cordova.  With hybrid mobile apps, developers can have one single code base for different platforms. Developers also can use their existing web development skills. The Ionic framework builds on top of Apache Cordova and provides out-of-box components which make developing hybrid mobile apps much easier. Ionic uses Angular as the JavaScript framework and has a nice default UI style with a similar look and feel to native apps. Firebase is a realtime database which can be accessed in web apps using JavaScript.
