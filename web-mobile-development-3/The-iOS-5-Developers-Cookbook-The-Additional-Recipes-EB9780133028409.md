Book Description
-----------------

This title contains the nine additional chapters that are also included in The iOS 5 Developer’s Cookbook: Expanded Electronic Edition. Note that this material is in addition to the print edition and standard eBook edition of The iOS 5 Developer’s Cookbook.
Erica Sadun’s iOS “Developer’s Cookbooks” have established themselves as the single best source of knowledge and sample code for production-quality iOS development. There’s only one problem: To support Apple’s breakthrough iOS 5, Sadun has created more great content and recipes than can fit in a single printed book. So we’ve bundled nine chapters of powerful iOS 5 solutions into an indispensable low-cost online supplement: The iOS 5 Developer’s Cookbook: The Additional Recipes. These “Additional Recipes” will help you master the latest iOS 5 techniques and best practices for managing documents and data sharing; connecting to the iOS Address Book; integrating Apple’s iCloud; working with Core Location and MapKit; integrating audio and video with MediaKit; providing push notifications to users; improving accessibility; integrating in-app purchasing with StoreKit; and even building games with GameKit. As with all Sadun’s proven iOS guides, Sadun teaches every new concept and technique through robust code that’s easy to reuse and extend. This isn’t just cut-and-paste: Using her examples, Sadun fully explains both the “how” and “why” of effective development. Whether you own Sadun’s previous books or not, if you want to build state-of-the-art iOS 5 apps, you’ll find these “Additional Recipes” absolutely indispensable.
