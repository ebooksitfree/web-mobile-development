Book Description
-----------------

 Summary
Ionic in Action teaches web developers how to build cross-platform mobile apps for phones and tablets on iOS and Android. You'll learn how to extend your web development skills to build apps that are indistinguishable from native iOS or Android projects.
About the Book
Wouldn’t it be great if you could build mobile apps using just your web development skills? With Ionic, you can do just that: create hybrid mobile apps using web technologies that you already know, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that will run on both iOS and Android.
Ionic in Action teaches web developers how to build mobile apps using Ionic and AngularJS. Through carefully explained examples, the book shows you how to create apps that use UI components designed for mobile, leverage current location, integrate with native device features like the camera, use touch gestures, and integrate with external data sources. Learn to test your apps to improve stability and catch errors as you develop. Finally, you’ll discover the command-line utility, and how to build and deploy to app stores.
What’s Inside
Create mobile apps with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
Design complex interfaces with Ionic’s UI controls
Build once and deploy for both iOS and Android
Use native device hardware and device-specific features
Covers the entire mobile development process
About the Reader
Readers should know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Familiarity with AngularJS is helpful but not required.
