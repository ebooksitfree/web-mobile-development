Book Description
-----------------

 App Development Recipes for iOS and watchOS explores the technical side of app development with tips and tricks to avoid those little things that become big frustrations, outside of the realm of development, causing many people to throw up their hands and say "It's just not worth the hassle!"
The experiential nature of this work sets it apart from other iOS and watchOS books. Even if you are a developer who is completely new to Swift, iOS or watchOS, you'll find the right experienced-based answers to important questions like "Why do I need version control?", "Why is testing so important?" and more specific problems directly related to iOS and watchOS development with Swift. We discover and summarize the most common problems and derive the solutions; not just a short answer and screenshot, but a systematic, logical derivation, that is, how we got to the solution.
After the introductory basics, each chapter delivers a problem statement and a solution. The experienced developer may, without losing anything, skip to whatever problem with which they are currently dealing. At the same time, we guide the less experienced developer through the process with focus on solving problems along the way.
What you will learn:
iOS career options for the new developer
Working with Source Code and Version Control
How to work with iOS accessory devices
Understanding development methodologies such as Agile/Scrum
User Experience Development and UI Tools
Unit, UI, and Beta Testing
Publishing your work
Who this book is for:
