Book Description
-----------------

Mobile-app development, and mobile-game-app development in particular, is attracting developers with the promise of a large and growing user base and ginormous unit sales. For example, over during the Christmas holiday, Tapulous reported iOS users were downloading the newest version of Tap Tap Revenge 25,000 times per hour, peaking at 45,000 downloads per hour on Christmas day.  This book teaches iOS game development fundamentals. The book is broken up into sections, each building from the last. By the end of the book, the reader will have a firm grasp on the concepts of game development for iOS devices.  The book offers real world examples and actual games the reader can code and play and is aimed at people who understand programming concepts but are new to iOS game development.
