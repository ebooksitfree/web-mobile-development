Book Description
-----------------

Use this handy field guide as a quick reference book and&nbsp;cheat sheet for all of the techniques you use or reference day to day.&nbsp;Covering up to Android 11, this Android Java programming reference guide focuses on non-UI elements with a security focus. You won’t see Android UI development, nor will you see low-level C or kernel techniques. Instead, this book focuses on easily digestible, useful, and interesting techniques in Java and the Android system.&nbsp;
 
This reference guide was created out of the need for myself to jot down all the useful techniques I commonly reached for, and so I’m now sharing these techniques with you, whether you are&nbsp;an Android internals software engineer or security researcher.&nbsp;
