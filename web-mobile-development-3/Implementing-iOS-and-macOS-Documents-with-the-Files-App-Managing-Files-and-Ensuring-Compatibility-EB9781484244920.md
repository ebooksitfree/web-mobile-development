Book Description
-----------------

 Rise above the basics of Xcode app development to implement tools like Share buttons and activity view controllers to share document content including parts of documents with other users and with other devices. This book fills the gap so that developers with even a fundamental knowledge of iOS and Swift can implement document creation, saving, and sharing in their apps.
Since the launch of iPhone in 2007, users and developers have struggled with the fact that the file system is hidden. Fortunately the Files app in iOS 11 now offers this feature and it is supported by Apple apps such as Numbers, Pages, and Keynote as well as by the few third-party apps that support documents. By using the standard formats described in this book, you can make your app’s data shareable to and from other apps like Numbers, Pages, and Word. Files also provides an interface to tools such as Dropbox and iCloud so that users can open and modify documents in them. If you combine standard formats such as .doc, .docx, .jpeg, and .jpg with Dropbox and eMail, you have a simple way to implement and use cross-platform sharing to Macs, PCs, and Android devices.Implementing iOS and macOS Documents with the Files App provides the combination of skills developers need to build these types of apps—working with files and constructing documents.What You'll Learn
