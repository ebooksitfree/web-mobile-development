Book Description
-----------------

Develop handy, UI/UX friendly and eye-pleasing widgets&nbsp;using the brand new WidgetKit. Apple’s brand new widgets allow iOS users to work with their favorite apps in the home screen of their iPhone or iPad without even opening the app!
Join us in this exciting journey as we explore the APIs introduced in Apple’s WidgetKit framework. You'll dive into the human interface guidelines (HIG) for creating widgets and review the recommendations Apple gives to developers for developing widgets with intuitive, easy-to-learn, and consistent user interfaces. In addition, you’ll take a look at some SwiftUI views that are useful not only in creating widgets for iOS apps, but also for creating iOS apps themselves.
You’ll put everything you learn into practical application by actually writing code and creating widgets. Get a clear view of how everything works so that you’re able to incorporate widgets into your real-world projects authentically and successfully.
