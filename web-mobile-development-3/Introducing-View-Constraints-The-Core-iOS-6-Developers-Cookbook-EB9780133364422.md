Book Description
-----------------

The iOS 6 software development kit (SDK) has revolutionized view layout. Apple's layout features will make your life easier and your interfaces more consistent, regardless of device geometry and orientation. In this excerpt from The iOS Developer's Cookbook-Core Recipes for Programmers (Early Edition), bestselling author and developer Erica Sadun introduces code-level constraint development. You'll discover how to create relations between on-screen objects and specify the way iOS automatically arranges your views. The outcome is a set of robust rules that adapt to screen geometry.
